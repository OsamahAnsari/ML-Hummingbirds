## Background

This repository showcases the end result of the research conducted in Fall 2020 at the University of Michigan for my independent research project, **[Project Talos](https://projecttalos.com/)**. 
Project Talos sought to research into the application of machine learning in game development. 
The end goals of this project were as follows:  
- Create a simple, yet enjoyable game centered around machine learning agents
- Documenting the process on a weekly basis
- Show the viability of machine learning in game development


## Results

- A publically released, fully playable game using machine learning agents as a central feature
	- Received overwhelmingly positive feedback on said game
- A website documenting the full journey of the research project
	- Contains weekly developer blogs
